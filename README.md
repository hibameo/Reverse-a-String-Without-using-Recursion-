# Reverse String Without Recursion

This Python script reads a string from an input file, reverses it without using recursion, and saves the reversed string into an output file.

## Features
- Reads input from `input.txt`
- Reverses the string using an iterative approach
- Saves the reversed string to `output.txt`

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository or download the script.
2. Create an `input.txt` file in the same directory as the script.
3. Write any string inside `input.txt`.
4. Run the script using:
   ```bash
   python reverse_string.py
   ```
5. Check the `output.txt` file for the reversed string.

## Example
**input.txt:**
```
Hello, World!
```

**output.txt:**
```
!dlroW ,olleH
```
